#Simple CSV Sorter

A command-line tool created for sorting CSV files.

This was drafted up in the course of an evening in June or July of 2013 as a freelance gig. The client needed something that could sort a CSV file by any of its columns, and reverse its order if necessary.

It outputs to the command-line (as initially requested), but that's a bit unwieldy for large CSV files like the example. I may change this later.

###Running

When running, make sure your active directory contains the CSV file you're sorting.

###Future Plans

* Command-line options for selecting a different CSV file from the default that is hardcoded in.
* Output to a CSV format instead of the command-line.
